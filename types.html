		 <h3>Some computer processes are very lengthy and time-consuming. To speed the same process, a job with a similar type of needs are batched together and run as a group.
		 <br /> 
		 The user of a batch operating system never directly interacts with the computer. In this type of OS, every user prepares his or her job on an offline device like a punch card and submit it to the computer operator.</h3>
		 <h2>- Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems :</h2>
		 <img src="timesharing.png" />
		 <h3>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</h3>
		 <h2>- Real time OS :</h2>

		 <h3>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems.</h3>
		 <h2>- Distributed Operating System :</h2>
		 <img src="dos.png" />
		 <h3>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</h3>
		 <h2>- Network Operating System :</h2>
		 <img src="nos.png" />
		 <h3>Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.</h3>
		 <h2>- Mobile OS : </h2>
